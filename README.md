# sql-coding
Welcome to my SQL Projects Repository! üè•üíæ

This collection showcases my SQL work developed through hands-on experience at Valley Behavioral Health, where I specialized in healthcare data analysis, reporting, and system integration. Many of the scripts here were inspired by real-world projects involving electronic health record (EHR) systems, payer data validation, and large-scale data transfers between platforms such as Streamline, Paylocity, and Axiom.

If you‚Äôre a potential employer or collaborator, explore the folders to see examples of complex queries, stored procedures, and ETL workflows built to support clinical operations, billing accuracy, and regulatory reporting. Each project is carefully documented to highlight not just technical skill‚Äîlike query optimization and data modeling‚Äîbut also the data governance and problem-solving mindset required in healthcare analytics.
